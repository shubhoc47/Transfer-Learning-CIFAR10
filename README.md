## Project Overview
This project applies transfer learning to the CIFAR-10 dataset using pre-trained models to classify images into 10 categories (airplanes, cars, birds, cats, etc.). Two CNN architectures, **VGG16** and **ResNet50**, are fine-tuned for this task.

Key steps include:
- Loading and preprocessing the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Building and modifying pre-trained models for classification.
- Tuning hyperparameters using Keras Tuner.
- Evaluating and comparing the performance of VGG16 and ResNet50.

## Dataset
The **CIFAR-10** dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

### Classes:
- Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck

## Models Used
- **VGG16**: A 16-layer deep CNN pre-trained on ImageNet.
- **ResNet50**: A 50-layer deep CNN that uses residual connections.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Transfer-Learning-CIFAR10.git
   cd Transfer-Learning-CIFAR10
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure you have the correct environment setup (e.g., GPU enabled with TensorFlow if needed).

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook for full implementation:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Assignment_3.ipynb
   ```

2. Alternatively, run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python assignment_3.py
   ```

## Results
- **VGG16**: Achieved a validation accuracy of **75.99%**.
- **ResNet50**: Achieved a validation accuracy of **76.97%**.
  
Both models showed signs of overfitting, but ResNet50 generalized slightly better.

### Sample Results:
- **Training Accuracy (VGG16)**: 99.86%
- **Validation Accuracy (VGG16)**: 75.99%
- **Training Accuracy (ResNet50)**: 96.52%
- **Validation Accuracy (ResNet50)**: 76.97%
